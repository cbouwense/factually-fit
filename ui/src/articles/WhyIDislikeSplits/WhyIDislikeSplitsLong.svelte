<p>In 2018, a friend of mine struggling with weight loss posted an article on Facebook. Its headline claimed "The Key to Weight Loss Is Diet Quality, Not Quantity, a New Study Finds." <C ref=2/> He extrapolated this title into propositions like "weight loss is not about how much you eat" (to be fair, I'm paraphrasing). Turns out, as it always does, the study<C ref=3/> the article was citing made no such claims at all. "Dr. Gardner [the lead researcher] said it is not that calories don't matter. After all, both groups ultimately ended up consuming fewer calories on average by the end of the study, even though they were not conscious of it."<C ref=2/></p>
<p>Even scientific reviews published in well respected journals can have ludicrous titles. Take <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5639963/">"Reducing Calorie Intake May Not Help You Lose Body Weight"</a> published by the the National Institute of Health. This article concludes in part "there is evidence of physiological mechanisms that monitor intake, although Western society often ensures that they are overwhelmed and obesity develops."<C ref=4/> What? How is that sentence coherent, much less supporting the assertion that calorie reduction may not help you lose body weight?</p>

<p>Ironically, I agree with the actual conclusions of the study cited by the New York Times. Focus on <em>how</em> to consume fewer calories with the least amount of effort. Whether it is keto, Whole30&trade;, veganism, fasting, or simply calorie counting, all that matters is you eat less than require for daily function,<C ref=3/> When asked what calorie deficit I maintained when I lost 40 pounds in three months, the answer is I don't really know. I probably consumed 1000 calories a day, but I never counted. I <em>do</em> know I ate less, and found a strategy that I enjoyed to achieve such.</p>
<p>Consider building financial wealth. You can be an entrepeneur, learn a profession, or even gamble on horse races. Some professions are slow and steady, with a high change of payoff for the patient. Some are get-rich-quick schemes that have a high risk for high reward. All valid strategies share one thing in common: making more money than you spend. If your net worth is growing, your strategy is working <em>by definition</em>. Under the hood, you are earning money faster than you are spending it, but that's so fundamental you don't obsess over that idea, and no amount of sensational headlines would make you question that dynamic. Though not a perfect analogy, the same logic applies to weight loss.</p>

<p>So often with weight loss I see people make claims when they have never actually accomplished serious success with it; in fact, it's generally the opposite! It seems like the people who come to me for advice about weight loss are always telling me why my notions don't align with theirs, and why my weight loss must have been a fluke.</p>
<p>I've found the people who are the best at cutting weight are the first to admit that strategies for weight loss are strictlyl personal preference, as long as you sustain a calorie deficit. Backstage at my first body building competition, everyone was chatting about the different ways that worked for them to maintain insane calorie deficits while cutting for the competition. Some people just ate the same food, but in less amounts. Most competitors ate very low carbohydrate to lose fat, some ate very high protein, and some even (to my surprise) ate <em>high</em> carbohydrate. The strategy was arbitrary, the goal was not. Everyone understood that the point was to drastically decrease calorie consumption, and we were all competing in part to see who had the most successful strategy for doing so.</p>
<Dots />
<p>Study <C ref=1 /> after study <C ref=5 /> after study <C ref=6 /> confirms the common sense notion of eating less to weigh less. I personally don't count calories, but I also undestand they're what weight loss is all about.</p>

<p>Weight is determined by the quantity of food you eat, not its "quality."<C ref=1 /> It is exclusively a matter of calories in versus calories out.<C ref=2 /> Claims that food quality are more important than quantity <C ref=3 /> are word games of half-truths wrapped in dubious advice. Counting calories isn't necessary to lose weight, but eating less of them is.</p>

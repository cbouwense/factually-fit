<p>In 2018, a friend of mine struggling with weight loss linked an article on Facebook. Its headline claimed "The Key to Weight Loss Is Diet Quality, Not Quantity, a New Study Finds." <C ref=3 /> I was very concerned at the way he extrapolated this article's title, and I decided to read it for myself. Turns out, as it always does, the study the article was citing made no such claims at all. "Dr. Gardner [the lead researcher] said it is not that calories don't matter. After all, both groups ultimately ended up consuming fewer calories on average by the end of the study, even though they were not conscious of it." <C ref=3 /> How confusing, and how misleading.</p>

<p>I agree with everything the study asserted about weight loss, and the strategy it tested for sustained dieting. Focus on how to consume fewer calories with the least amount of effort. Whatever strategy gets you there, whether it is keto, Whole30, veganism, fasting, or simply calorie counting, it does not matter. All that matters is you eat less than require for daily function,<C ref=1 /> and do so in a way that is neither dangerous nor unsustainable.<C ref=2 />That message is not what readers of Mr. O'Connor's article will walk away with, unless they read the entire article, including the last paragraph where the study's lead researcher contradict's their claims. Indeed, it is not what my friend came away with, nor the dozens of commenters agreening with him, back when this article came out.</p>

<p>It is my strong conviction that you can only learn by doing. Once you experience failure, you realize you need to change. When you experience success, you need to evaluate what not to change. So often with weight loss I see people make claims when they have never actually accomplished serious success with it; in fact, it's generally the opposite! It seems like the people who come to me for advice about weight loss are always telling me why my notions don't align with theirs, and why my weight loss must have been a fluke. I've found the people who are the best at cutting weight are the first to admit that strategies for weight loss are irrelevant, as long as you sustain a calorie deficit. Backstage at my first body building competition, everyone was chatting about the different ways that worked for them to maintain insane calorie deficits while cutting for the competition. Some people just the same but less, most competitors ate very low carbohydrate, some ate very high protein, and some even (to my surprise) ate high carbohydrate. The common thread was experience: nobody there could have increased their calorie intake and somehow cut weight for the competition. It simply just does not work like that.</p>

<p>Diets are strikingly similar to girlfriends. When you find one that you love, it's easy to stick with it. You may defend them when they're wrong, and you're probably blind to some of their faults. Disagreements will occur once in a while, and you might even break up. They're certainly not perfect, but if you're right for each other, you just know it. There are plenty of fish in the sea, and with some effort you eventually you find yours.</p>
<p>I love keto because it works for me. I devour bacon and I worship cheese. Both are ketogenic. I don't like starving myself and ketosis keeps me satiated. I like quick results. Keto works quite rapidly for me.</p>
<p>This is not an article on insulin, ketones, carbohydrate, or triglycerides. I just want to answer the simple question for anyone curious: what's all the hype about?</p>
<Dots />
<p>I think an illustration of a typical day of mine on keto is worth demonstrating. I wake up and weigh myself. Usually I see a weight drop of half of a pound. I find this to be an extremely motivating way to start my day. I make a cup of coffee with some cream, but Splenda instead of sugar. "Darn, I like sugar in my coffee" I might think. Then I'd remember the half pound of progress, and the Splenda actually tastes pretty good to me. The sugar no longer seems very important.</p>
<p>Breakfast time arrives, but I'm not really hungry. In fact, I am generally be so uninterested in food that I won't eat until mid afternoon. No willpower necessary, I am just not hungry. Around three o'clock I feel some hunger pangs, and I make myself a meal. If I am very hungry I cook a large meal, but usually I just want a snack. Pizza sounds good, but I have some taco salad leftovers. "Darn, I want pizza" I think. The taco bowl is heated up and slowly savored. Pizza no longer seems very important.</p>
<p>My sweet tooth awakens. Some diet soda is opened and, to my surprise, tastes incredible. This effect is amplified  when you take a break from sugar. Coke Zero tastes like the original formula when you're on a low carbohydrate diet.</p> <p>Dinner time rolls around. Cooking seems like a chore, so I order my favorite Chipotle bowl without rice or beans. "Darn, I prefer burritos over bowls," I lament. Then I crack into the layers of queso, guac, and extra meat. A tortilla no longer seems very important.</p>
<p>I would go to bed, wake up, and the next day I am another half of a pound.</p>

<p>People in my life have tried (and retried) keto and decided it is not for them. Their conclusions were not drawn from a failure to lose weight, but rather because they didn't like the food. Sometimes it didn't sit well with their stomachs, other times they just wanted a plate full of vegetables (or junk food). The point is not that </p>
<p>I love keto not because it is easy, but because it is doable. I see reasonably consistent progress, and the food is mostly what I already eat. It works for me.</p>

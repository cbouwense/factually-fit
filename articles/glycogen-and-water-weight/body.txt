If you are interested in weight loss you will eventually run into the term "water weight." This phrase has always seemed kind of nebulous to me, and maybe even a fantasy. However, the scientific literature has an explanation of this phenomenon, why it occurs, and what it means for weight loss and gain.

When you step on a scale, the number you see is a composite of many different things: fat, lean muscle mass, organs, waste, bone, and a whole host of other components. One of these components is the weight due to the water that is stored in your body, or "water weight."{4} Consider the scenario of weighing yourself before and immediately after drinking a glass of water. 16 fluid ounces of water weighs one pound. In this scenario, if you weigh 200 pounds before you drink the glass of water, you will weigh 201 pounds after drinking the glass. An obvious conclusion, but it is an important concept: water inside of you contributes to the number on the scale!

In the above scenario, the water would be in your stomach completely unabsorbed by your body. When we talk about water weight in regards to body composition, we are not talking about unabsorbed water, but water that your cells are holding for physiological processes. The most relevant of these processes is the storage of glycogen. Glycogen is "a branched polymer of glucose."{3} In other words, a bunch of sugar strung together by molecular bonds. Muscles will use their glycogen stores for fuel before dipping into blood glucose.{1} This is analogous to steam-powered trains having a coal carriage. If the fire powering the steam engine gets low, the engineers shovel coal out of the coal car and into the fire. This is a finite resource, and needs to be refilled. In the analogy of the train, the engineers replenish the coal carriage when they stop at a station. Similarly, your body replenishes your glycogen stores with blood glucose.{4}
\d
For every 1 gram of glycogen stored in your body, at least 3 grams of water are also stored.{2} This is the critical point: when we talk about water weight in weight loss we are referring to the water that glycogen holds. After absorbing the nutrients from food, an average individual will have around 500 grams of glycogen in their body, and therefore 1500 grams of water (3.3 pounds) stored with that glycogen.{4}
\d
The cited 3.3 pounds of water weight is an average, and your body may store a different amount, but the actual value is irrelevant to the concept. As your body depletes your glycogen stores, the water stored with this glycogen will also deplete. This means that the 3.3 pounds of water weight will be the first movement on the scale. The body will use glycogen as a fuel source before dipping into your fat stores, since "the energy deficit required to reduce weight with glycogen as fuel [...] is far less than fat."{2} Therefore, "small energy deficits [...] early in a weight-reduction diet can produce the illusion of significant fat loss. [...] The ease with which this weight will be regained can be disheartening to a dieter. The apparent ease of early weight losses can also lead to unrealistic expectations of the ability of a modest energy restriction or even exercise to achieve significant weight losses."{2}

In other words, when you restrict calories to lose weight, you will first deplete your glycogen stores, and lose a lot of water weight very rapidly. In my experience, this can happen in a few days. On the flip side, when you resume your normal eating habits, you will also regain this water weight very rapidly. Even crazier, after three days of refeeding after a low-calorie diet "glycogen stores rise sixfold higher [comapared to low-calorie levels], to more than twice normal."{2} This means that after a diet your body will store on average 6.6 pounds of water weight! Consider the example of restricting calories for two weeks. Say you lose 6 pounds of weight, and assume you are exercising so you are retaining your lean muscle mass. Assuming for simplicity your body conforms to the average, about 3 pounds of that loss will come from water weight, and 3 pounds will be fat. Now suppose you resume your pre-diet eating habits and suddenly regain all six pounds. According to The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, all six pounds are water weight. To use their wording: "this excessive glycogen repletion, with associated water, could follow inappropriate refeeding after dieting, leading to rapid and excessive nonfat weight regain."{2} That bears repeating: that increase on the scale is not fat. Though the number on the scale will look like those two weeks of hard work have been totally reversed, you have lost three pounds of fat.
